This project conducts simulations of the SD7003 airfoil utilizing RANS-based transition models. The outcomes, derived from a calibrated model, are compared with our in-house high-fidelity DNS and experimental data, showing a good agreement. Quantities of interest include the identification and dimensions of the laminar separation bubble (LSB), the transition from laminar to turbulent flow, as well as the skin friction coefficient and pressure coefficient.
