At present, I hold the position of a postdoctoral associate at Cornell University. My current research revolves around devising effective data-driven frameworks aimed at estimating aleatory and epistemic uncertainties in physical models, specifically RANS/LES CFD models. I am presently exploring Kalman filtering algorithms based on Bayes' theorem. I intend to disseminate my findings through my website and welcome any inquiries or discussions. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or wish to connect!
